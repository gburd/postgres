-- happened at that choke point.  A regression here shows up as

--
-- PRE-EXISTING GAP, recorded here rather than hidden: dead_after_rollback_prepared
-- is 0.  ROLLBACK PREPARED does not currently drive the index-UNDO apply path,
-- so these entries are left to VACUUM.  Verified identical on the pre-batching
-- build (with a plain-ROLLBACK control on the same table reversing 60/60), so
-- deferral neither caused nor worsened it.  What this case does prove is that
-- PREPARE itself is safe: it does not error, lose the chain, or trip the
-- AtPrepare_XactUndo() assertion, and the committed rows stay index-reachable.

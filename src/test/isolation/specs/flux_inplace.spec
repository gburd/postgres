# FLUX Phase 8c: always-in-place indexed-column UPDATE via delete-marking.
#
# Validates the MVCC visibility of an in-place key UPDATE across snapshots:
#   - a REPEATABLE READ reader whose snapshot predates the key UPDATE keeps
#     seeing the OLD key + value (reachable through the delete-marked old
#     index entry), and does NOT see the row under the NEW key;
#   - a reader whose snapshot follows the UPDATE sees only the NEW key;
#   - the TID is stable, so no row moves.
# Both the old and new versions are reached via the SAME index; the delete-
# marking key recheck (invariant I2) ensures neither snapshot sees a duplicate
# or a phantom.

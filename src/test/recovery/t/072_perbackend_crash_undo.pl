# FILEOPS crash-recovery revert via the COMMON WAL stream (no UNDO engine).
#
# FILEOPS was briefly the first per-backend UNDO consumer, but its
# crash-recovery revert has since been moved to the common WAL stream
# (RM_FILEOPS_ID forward records + fileops_redo + fileops_cleanup): filesystem
# structural operations are cluster-wide changes whose durability/revert belong
# in the common WAL, replayed like heap's own records -- NOT in any table-AM
# UNDO log.  This test proves that model is crash-safe.
#
# A transaction produces FILEOPS create/chmod (immediate, WAL-flushed), then the
# server is crashed (immediate stop) BEFORE the transaction commits.  On
# recovery:
#   - fileops_redo() REDOES the forward create/chmod unconditionally and records
#     each reversible op's xid + self-describing before-state, then
#   - fileops_cleanup() (the RM_FILEOPS_ID rm_cleanup callback, run at end of
#     redo) reverses every op whose owning xid did NOT commit:
#       - the created file is unlinked (CREATE revert), and
#       - the chmod'd file's mode is restored (CHMOD revert, before-state in WAL).
# No per-backend (or fork) UNDO engine is involved.
#
# FILEOPS only writes WAL at wal_level >= replica (XLogIsNeeded()), so the test
# runs at wal_level = replica, matching any FILEOPS deployment.

 * undoapply.c
 *	  Generic UNDO record application during transaction rollback
 *
 * When a transaction aborts, this module walks the UNDO chain backward
 * from the most recent record to the first.  For each record, it
 * dispatches to the appropriate resource manager's rm_undo callback
 * based on the urec_rmid field in the record header.
 *
 * This module is AM-agnostic: it contains no AM- or subsystem-specific
 * code.  All such UNDO application logic lives in the respective resource
 * managers, each registered via RegisterUndoRmgr() (see access/undormgr.h).
 *
 * The dispatch pattern is analogous to WAL resource managers: each RM
 * registers its callbacks via RegisterUndoRmgr(), and this module
 * routes UNDO records to the correct handler.

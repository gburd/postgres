 *	  UNDO worker background process implementation
 *
 * The UNDO worker periodically discards old UNDO records that are no
 * longer needed by any active transaction. This is essential for
 * preventing unbounded growth of UNDO logs.
 *
 * The worker also advances the undo_discard_horizon, allowing WAL
 * segments containing fully-discarded UNDO batches to be recycled.
 *
 * Design based on ZHeap's UNDO worker and PostgreSQL's autovacuum
 * launcher patterns.

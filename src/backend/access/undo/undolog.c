 * undolog.c
 *	  PostgreSQL UNDO log manager -- WAL-integrated version
 *
 * With UNDO-in-WAL, UNDO records are stored in the standard WAL stream
 * as XLOG_UNDO_BATCH records.  The separate base/undo/ segment files,
 * direct pwrite()/pread() I/O path, and per-backend fd cache have been
 * removed.  This file retains:
 *
 * - GUC parameters (undo_retention_time, etc.)
 * - Shared memory structures for UNDO state tracking
 * - Discard pointer management (repurposed for WAL-based UNDO)
 * - Checkpoint support (statistics logging)
 *
 * The previous functions (UndoLogAllocate, UndoLogWrite, UndoLogRead,
 * UndoLogSync, UndoLogSealAndRotate, etc.) are removed.  Callers now
 * use UndoRecordSetInsert() which writes directly to WAL via XLogInsert.

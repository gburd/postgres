 * xactundo.c
 *	  Management of undo record sets for transactions
 *
 * Undo records that need to be applied after a transaction or
 * subtransaction abort should be inserted using the functions defined
 * in this file; thus, every table or index access method that wants to
 * use undo for post-abort cleanup should invoke these interfaces.
 *
 * The reason for this design is that we want to pack all of the undo
 * records for a single transaction into one place, regardless of the
 * AM which generated them. That way, we can apply the undo actions
 * which pertain to that transaction in the correct order; namely,
 * backwards as compared with the order in which the records were
 * generated.
 *
 * We may use up to three undo record sets per transaction, one per
 * persistence level (permanent, unlogged, temporary). We assume that
 * it's OK to apply the undo records for each persistence level
 * independently of the others. This is safe since the modifications
 * must necessarily touch disjoint sets of pages.
 *
 * CROSS-RELATION ORDERING INVARIANT (important for TOAST correctness):
 *
 * All UNDO records for all relations touched by a single transaction are
 * packed into the same UndoRecordSet, in strict WAL-LSN emission order.
 * The newest-first application order during rollback guarantees correct
 * restoration ordering for multi-object operations (e.g. a cluster-wide
 * consumer that touches several relations in one transaction).
 *
 * PARALLEL RECOVERY: XLOG_UNDO_BATCH records are handled by the startup
 * process via ApplyUndoChainFromWAL(); they are not dispatched to parallel
 * workers because UNDO application requires coordinated per-transaction
 * state.
 *
 * SUBTRANSACTION TRACKING:
 *
 * Subtransaction state is tracked using a dynamically-grown array allocated
 * in TopMemoryContext.  The array starts at INITIAL_SUBXACT_CAPACITY (64)
 * slots and doubles when needed via repalloc().  The array persists across
 * transactions within the same backend to avoid repeated allocation for
 * steady-state workloads.
 *
 * Growth via repalloc() in TopMemoryContext during SubXactCallbacks is safe
 * because it does not interact with pgstat's per-subtransaction tracking
 * (the original corruption bug was caused by palloc of new per-subtransaction
 * nodes in CurTransactionContext, not by growing an existing TopMemoryContext
 * allocation).
 *
 * This design follows the EDB undo-record-set branch architecture
 * (xactundo.c) adapted for the physical undo approach used here.

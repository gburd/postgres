 *
 * pbu_recovery.c
 *	  per-backend UNDO crash-recovery apply driver.
 *
 * After WAL redo reaches consistency, the ARIES-style undo phase must roll
 * back transactions that produced per-backend UNDO but did not commit before
 * the crash.  StartupUndoLogs() has already rebuilt the UndoLogControl banks
 * (insert/discard pointers) from the pg_undo/<redo> checkpoint snapshot, and
 * redo of the RM_UNDOLOG_ID records advanced them and rebuilt the xid->logno
 * map; the undo-page contents themselves were made durable by riding on their
 * producer's WAL record (RegisterUndoLogBuffers) and were replayed into the
 * shared buffers.  So the recovered undo logs contain, in insertion order, the
 * transaction-header chain: each transaction's first record carries a
 * UndoRecordTransaction header with the owning xid, its database, an
 * apply-progress marker, and uur_next -- the start location of the next
 * transaction.
 *
 * PbuPerformUndoRecovery() walks that chain across all active undo logs and,
 * for every LOSER transaction (wrote undo, did not commit, and is not a
 * prepared 2PC transaction awaiting explicit resolution), reverse-applies its
 * undo via execute_undo_actions() -- the same apply path used on live abort
 * (PbuAtAbort_ApplyUndo).  execute_undo_actions() is idempotent: it consults
 * the transaction header's uur_progress marker and returns early if the undo
 * was already (fully) applied, so re-processing a chain (e.g. reached again
 * from a second log) is harmless.
 *
 * IN-FLIGHT LOSERS AND DEFERRED COMPLETION
 *
 * The inline apply cannot finish the job for a table or index AM.  Every AM
 * undo callback (flux_undo_apply, zheap_undo_apply, recno_undo_apply, and the
 * nbtree/hash callbacks) returns UNDO_APPLY_SKIPPED unconditionally while
 * InRecovery is set: reverting a row needs the relcache/syscache to open the
 * relation, and reversing the index side of an in-place indexed-column UPDATE
 * needs the index AMs -- neither of which the startup process has (calling the
 * index AMs from it crashes).  So for a transaction that was an IN-FLIGHT LOSER
 * at the crash instant -- its ROLLBACK had not been applied, and a CHECKPOINT
 * had already made its post-update pages durable -- the inline apply reverts
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * That outcome used to be indistinguishable from success, so such a transaction
 * was silently abandoned in its post-update state: the heap kept the
 * uncommitted value and the indexes kept the uncommitted key.
 *
 * execute_undo_actions() now reports whether every record was applied, and a
 * transaction it could not finish is registered as a rollback request --
 * PbuRegisterRecoveredRollbackReq() -- in the same shared rollback hash table
 * and xid/size queues a live abort uses.  After recovery the undo launcher
 * starts an undo apply worker for that database, which connects and calls
 * execute_undo_actions() with relcache, syscache and the index AMs available:
 * the same code path, and the same end state, as a live ROLLBACK.
 *
 * Registering the request also pins the chain: the discard worker skips undo
 * logs with an outstanding entry in the rollback hash table, so the undo cannot
 * be discarded before the deferred rollback has consumed it.
 *
 * Between the end of recovery and the worker's pass, a loser transaction's rows
 * are still physically present with their uncommitted values, but they are not
 * visible: all three AMs resolve visibility through the status of the writing
 * xid (the sLog for flux, the transaction slot / undo chain for zheap, HLC plus
 * xid status for recno), and that xid did not commit.  Readers therefore see
 * the pre-update row throughout.  The deferred apply restores the before-image
 * physically and repairs the index entries.
 *
 * If no undo apply worker can run (single-user mode) the request cannot be
 * drained, so we report a WARNING naming the transaction instead of claiming a
 * rollback that will not happen.
 *
 * Prepared (2PC) transactions are skipped here: their per-backend undo
 * location is persisted in the 2PC state file (see twophase.c) and applied by
 * pbu_twophase_postabort() on ROLLBACK PREPARED, or discarded on COMMIT
 * PREPARED.
 *
 * This runs before WAL insertion is re-enabled, matching the fork engine's
 * PerformUndoRecovery(); the apply itself writes no new WAL (durability of the
 * revert is provided by the end-of-recovery checkpoint), and the apply
 * callbacks that need syscache (e.g. nbtree) defer to the post-recovery undo
 * apply worker via UNDO_APPLY_SKIPPED (they check InRecovery).  FILEOPS undo
 * apply is path-based and completes synchronously here.

 * PbuRegisterRecoveredRollbackReq
 *		Queue a loser transaction whose undo could not be applied inline for

 *
 * Returns true if the request was queued (or was already queued by an earlier
 * pass over the same chain), false if there is no way to drain it, in which
 * case the caller must not count the transaction as rolled back.
 *
 * RegisterRollbackReq() enters the request in the shared rollback hash table
 * and pushes it onto the xid and size queues.  Two properties matter here:
 *
 *  - The hash-table entry makes the discard worker leave this transaction's
 *    undo alone, so the chain survives until the deferred rollback consumes it.
 *  - The queue entry is what the undo launcher polls; it runs with
 *    bgw_start_time = BgWorkerStart_RecoveryFinished, so it begins draining
 *    exactly when the system opens for writes, which is the earliest moment the
 *    apply can legally run.
 *
 * We pass end_urec_ptr explicitly instead of letting RegisterRollbackReq derive
 * it.  The derivation (FindUndoEndLocationAndSize) resolves the chain end from
 * the log's live insert pointer and asserts the transaction is the log's current
 * owner; for a chain recovered from a crashed log neither holds, whereas our
 * caller has just computed the exact boundary during the chain walk.  Note the
 * convention: end_urec_ptr is the transaction's LATEST undo record (inclusive),
 * which is what UndoWorkerPerformRequest() hands to execute_undo_actions() as
 * its 'from' pointer -- not the exclusive end of the chain's address range.
 *
 * RegisterRollbackReq() returns false in single-user mode (!IsUnderPostmaster),
 * where its normal contract is "the calling backend should apply the undo
 * itself".  The startup process must not do that (no relcache, no index AMs),
 * and in single-user mode there is no worker either, so that case is reported to
 * the caller as un-drainable rather than silently dropped.

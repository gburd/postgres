 * undo.c
 *	  Common undo layer coordination
 *
 * The undo subsystem consists of several logically separate subsystems
 * that work together to achieve a common goal. The code in this file
 * provides a limited amount of common infrastructure that can be used
 * by all of those various subsystems, and helps coordinate activities
 * such as shared memory initialization and startup/shutdown.
 *
 * This file has no compile-time or link-time dependency on any specific
 * table or index access method.  Shared memory for AM-specific tracking
 * structures (such as an optional per-tuple tracking hash an AM may register)
 * is registered as its own sibling entry in storage/subsystemlist.h, not
 * sized or initialized here.  Likewise, the
 * set of UNDO resource managers to register comes from access/undormgrlist.h
 * (mirroring the subsystemlist.h idiom): a new consumer adds itself to that
 * list, and never edits this file.
 *
 * Shared memory initialization uses the PG_SHMEM_SUBSYSTEM pattern:
 * UndoShmemCallbacks is registered in subsystemlist.h, and the framework
 * calls UndoShmemRequest() and UndoShmemInit() at the appropriate times
 * during postmaster startup.

 *    ShmemInitStruct() self-attaches via AttachShmemIndexEntry() when
 *    IsUnderPostmaster, re-assigns the module global, and reports found=true so
 *    the one-time "if (!found)" initialization block is correctly skipped.

 * 2. The UndoRmgrs[] dispatch table and each registered AM's relundo hook
 *    function pointers, both rebuilt by RegisterUndoRmgrs() (idempotent:
 *    InitUndoRmgrs() zeroes the table first).

 * XactUndoShmemInit() and ATMShmemInit() are no-ops and so omitted here.  Any

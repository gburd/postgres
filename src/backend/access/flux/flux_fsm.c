 * NOTES
 *	  This is a thin wrapper over PostgreSQL's standard free space map
 *	  (src/backend/storage/freespace).  It adds FLUX-specific relation
 *	  extension (page initialization and WAL-logging of the new page) on
 *	  top of the generic GetPageWithFreeSpace/RecordPageWithFreeSpace API.
 *
 *	  Page defragmentation is handled entirely by VACUUM via
 *	  FluxPageDefragment() in flux_tuple.c; the FSM only tracks free
 *	  space, it does not schedule or perform compaction.

/*
 * FluxGetPageWithFreeSpace
 *
 * Find or create a page with at least 'needed' bytes of free space.
 *
 * First queries PostgreSQL's standard FSM (GetPageWithFreeSpace).  If a
 * page is returned, that block is used directly.
 *
 * If no suitable existing page is found, extends the relation by allocating
 * a new page with ExtendBufferedRel(), initializes it with FluxInitPage(),
 * WAL-logs the initialization, and returns the new block.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   rel    - open relation
 *   needed - minimum number of free bytes required
 *
 * Returns the block number of a page with sufficient free space.

/*
 * FluxTargetFreeSpace
 *
 * Convert a raw tuple length into the amount of free space an insert should
 * ASK the FSM for, applying the fillfactor reservation the way heap does.
 *
 * Heap does this in RelationGetBufferForTuple (hio.c), and the clamp it
 * applies is not optional.  Adding the fillfactor reservation unconditionally
 * can push the request past what the FSM can represent (MaxFSMRequestSize ==
 * MaxHeapTupleSize); fsm_space_needed_to_cat() then rejects it outright with
 * "invalid FSM request size", which surfaces as a hard ERROR on a perfectly
 * legal INSERT.  FLUX hit exactly this: with fillfactor=10 the reservation is
 * 7428 bytes, so a 1000-byte row asked for 8428 and the INSERT failed where
 * heap accepted it (regression tests insert, brin, brin_bloom).
 *
 * The clamp must be expressed in FLUX's OWN page geometry, not heap's.  A FLUX
 * page reserves special space (FluxPageOpaqueData) that a heap page does not,
 * so the largest tuple that can ever live on a FLUX page is
 * FLUX_MAX_TUPLE_SIZE, which is strictly smaller than MaxHeapTupleSize.  Using
 * heap's bound here asks for more free space than any FLUX page can offer, the
 * FSM can never satisfy it, and the insert path's "retry until we find a
 * suitable page" loop spins forever -- an INSERT that HANGS instead of erroring.
 * Hence every quantity below is FLUX-native.
 *
 * Rule, mirroring heap: a nearly-empty page is good enough for a tuple that is
 * oversize relative to fillfactor, so once the reservation would push us past
 * nearlyEmptyFreeSpace we ask only for what the tuple itself needs (but at
 * least nearlyEmptyFreeSpace, so we don't settle for a page with a few spare
 * bytes).  That keeps the request satisfiable AND inside the FSM's range,
 * while preserving "don't extend the relation needlessly for a big row in a
 * low-fillfactor table".
 *
 * The result is only a hint: every caller re-checks the actual free space under
 * its own buffer lock and falls back to extending the relation.

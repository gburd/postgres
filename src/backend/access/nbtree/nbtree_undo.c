 *
 * nbtree_undo.c
 *	  nbtree UNDO resource manager
 *
 * This module implements UNDO apply callbacks for the B-tree index AM.
 * When a transaction aborts, provisionally inserted index entries are
 * removed (or marked LP_DEAD) so that VACUUM is not required to clean
 * up after aborted transactions.
 *
 * Combined with heap UNDO, nbtree UNDO provides a "zero-VACUUM"
 * experience for aborted transactions: both heap tuples and their
 * index entries are cleaned up immediately during rollback.
 *
 * UNDO Subtypes:
 *   INSERT_LEAF:   Undo a leaf-page index tuple insertion
 *   INSERT_UPPER:  Undo an internal-page downlink insertion
 *   INSERT_POST:   Undo a posting list split
 *   DEDUP:         Undo a deduplication pass (restore pre-dedup page)
 *   DELETE:        Undo an ad-hoc deletion (re-insert deleted tuples)
 *
 * Structural operations (SPLIT, NEWROOT) and VACUUM operations are
 * logged for completeness but their undo-apply is handled by falling
 * back to per-entry LP_DEAD marking rather than reversing the
 * structural change, since concurrent readers may have already
 * observed the new structure.
 *
 * All hooks are guarded by RelationUsesIndexUndo() -- nbtree UNDO is enabled
 * per relation by the parent table's index_undo reloption, independently of
 * whether (or how) the parent table AM writes its own table UNDO.  Records go
 * to the cluster-wide UNDO-in-WAL stream; see nbtree_undo_write().

 *
 * WHY NOT THE INDEX TUPLE
 * -----------------------
 * This record used to carry the whole inserted IndexTuple so the apply path
 * could prove identity by comparing bytes.  That made index UNDO's cost grow
 * with the key width -- the key bytes were paid for twice, once in nbtree's own
 * forward insert record and again here -- for a payload that is only ever used
 * as a comparison operand, never as data to restore.
 *
 * What the apply path actually needs is a DISCRIMINATOR: enough information to
 * be sure the slot it is about to mark LP_DEAD still holds this entry and not
 * some later, possibly COMMITTED, one.  So we store a discriminator instead of
 * the data:
 *
 *   heap_tid   -- the heap TID the entry points at.  This is the strong half.
 *                 (key, heap TID) is unique in a btree by construction, and heap
 *                 TID alone is nearly so: the only entries in one index sharing
 *                 a heap TID are entries for the same row, which differ in key.
 *   key_digest -- a hash over the key bytes, closing exactly that residual case.
 *                 Together they discriminate at least as well as the full-bytes
 *                 comparison did for every case that can actually arise, at a
 *                 fixed 4 bytes instead of the whole key.
 *
 * This is NOT a weakening of the relocation-safety guarantee.  That guarantee is
 * "never mark a slot dead unless it provably still holds THIS entry", and it is
 * enforced by verifying positively before the mark; the change is only in which
 * bytes the proof is made of.  Both discriminators must match, and a mismatch
 * still means "leave it for VACUUM", which is safe.  See
 * nbtree_undo_verify_leaf_entry().
 *
 * itup_sz is retained -- as uint16, not Size, since nbtree caps entries well
 * under a page (BTMaxItemSize) -- because the length is itself a cheap
 * discriminator and the apply path needs it to reject a slot whose tuple is a
 * different size.  As Size it cost 8 bytes plus 6 of alignment padding.
 *
 * The field order packs with no holes: 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 22 bytes, versus
 * 12 + MAXALIGN(key) before.

 * Index UNDO goes to the cluster-wide UNDO-in-WAL stream via the transaction's

 * storage/file/fileops.c).  Using the XactUndo* API rather than driving
 * UndoRecordSetCreate/UndoRecordSetInsert by hand is not a style preference --
 * it is what makes rollback work at all:
 *
 *   - PrepareXactUndoDataParts() sets XactUndo.has_undo, without which
 *     AtAbort_XactUndo() returns immediately and applies nothing;
 *   - InsertXactUndoData() records the batch LSN in XactUndo.last_batch_lsn[],
 *     which is the chain head ApplyUndoChainFromWAL() walks backward from, and
 *     calls SetCurrentTransactionUndoRecPtr() so the next record chains onto
 *     this one.
 *
 * Writing the batch directly, as this module used to, produced a correct
 * XLOG_UNDO_BATCH record that nothing ever read: the chain head was never
 * published, so a ROLLBACK silently reverted nothing.
 *
 * There is deliberately ONE write path.  Records are routed neither on the
 * parent table AM's am_undo_engine (index UNDO is a per-relation property --
 * see RelationUsesIndexUndo()) nor through the Tier-2 buffer (whose only
 * producer, FLUX, is a delete-marking AM and therefore never reaches here).
 *
 * The record is DEFERRED rather than written immediately.  One index insert
 * produces one of these records, so writing each one meant an XLOG_UNDO_BATCH
 * WAL record -- and a WAL insertion lock acquisition -- per index entry, which
 * is what made index UNDO cost 27-38% TPS.  DeferXactUndoData() instead leaves
 * the record in the UndoRecordSet buffer, so all of a statement's entries share
 * one batch; this is what that record set was built for (see the batching note
 * at the head of undoinsert.c).  xactundo.c flushes at every point that can
 * consume the chain -- transaction abort, subtransaction abort/commit, commit,
 * PREPARE -- and on crossing undo_batch_size_kb / undo_batch_record_limit, so a
 * deferred record is never the reason a rollback finds nothing to apply.
 *
 * The caller must NOT be in a critical section: PrepareXactUndoDataParts() can
 * palloc.  Deferral itself writes no WAL, so unlike the old path this function
 * no longer opens a critical section of its own.

 * any insert of a lower key can shift the aborted entry to a different slot --
 * or move it to another page entirely -- leaving a COMMITTED entry in the slot
 * the UNDO record names.  Marking that slot LP_DEAD then destroys committed
 * data: the row stays in the heap but becomes invisible to every index scan.
 *
 * So identity is settled POSITIVELY, against the discriminator the record
 * carries (see NbtreeUndoInsertLeaf), never by trusting the offset.  Three
 * things must all agree:
 *
 *   - the entry length, which rejects a differently-shaped tuple outright,
 *   - the heap TID, which distinguishes two entries with equal keys,
 *   - the key digest, which distinguishes two entries pointing at the same heap
 *     TID (possible across an in-place update of a different column).
 *
 * The record stores a 4-byte hash of the key rather than the key bytes.  For
 * the purpose this comparison serves the two are equivalent: a match means "this
 * slot still holds the entry we inserted", and (length, heap TID, key hash)
 * establishes that for every case that can arise in one index -- the only
 * entries sharing a heap TID are entries for the same row, and those differ in
 * key.  A hash collision would additionally have to coincide with an identical
 * heap TID and length on a slot the walk actually reaches.
 *
 * A posting-list tuple is never a match: dedup rewrote the slot, so the
 * original single entry no longer exists there and the caller must not touch
 * it.  Likewise a pivot tuple (the page became internal) is never a match.
 *
 * Returns true only when the slot provably still holds the aborted entry.

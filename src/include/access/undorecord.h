 *	  UNDO record format and insertion API
 *
 * This file defines the generic UNDO record format that can be used by
 * any access method or subsystem.  UNDO records are AM-agnostic: each
 * record carries an RM ID (urec_rmid) that identifies the resource
 * manager responsible for interpreting and applying the record.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Physical: UNDO stores opaque payload data for direct restore
 * - Generic: Usable by any AM or subsystem
 * - Compact: Variable-length format to minimize space
 * - Chained: Records form backward chains via urec_prev pointer
 * - Batch-oriented: API encourages batching for performance
 * - AM-agnostic: No AM-specific types in the generic header or API

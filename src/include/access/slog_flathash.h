 * slog_flathash.h
 *	  LWLock-protected flat open-addressing hash for sLog tuple tracking.
 *
 * This provides read access to sLog tuple entries under the per-partition
 * writer_lock LWLock.  The flat hash uses open addressing with linear probing
 * and tombstone markers for deletions.
 *
 * Architecture: A SINGLE copy of the hash lives in shared memory, guarded
 * by a per-partition writer_lock LWLock (SLogFlatPartition.writer_lock).
 * Writers take the lock LW_EXCLUSIVE and mutate the single copy in place;
 * readers take it LW_SHARED for the duration of a read, copy data into local
 * variables, and release.  Reader/writer exclusion is entirely by the LWLock
 * (this replaces an earlier seqlock reader/writer scheme; the measured
 * read:write ratio was not read-dominated enough for the seqlock to pay off).
 *
 * Scan semantics: SLogFlatHashScanInit/ScanNext iterate all occupied
 * buckets linearly.  Read-side scans must run inside SLOG_SEQ_READ_BEGIN/END
 * (which take writer_lock LW_SHARED) and may only copy data into locals; a
 * writer holds writer_lock LW_EXCLUSIVE and mutates fp->hash directly.  For
 * write operations that need global scans (eviction, xid removal), the
 * pattern is: scan fp->hash under the writer lock (stable, no reader can tear
 * it), collect keys, then apply write ops.

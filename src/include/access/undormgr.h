 *	  UNDO resource manager dispatch definitions
 *
 * This module provides a dispatch mechanism for UNDO record application,
 * analogous to the WAL resource manager (rmgr) system.  Each access method
 * or subsystem that writes UNDO records registers an UndoRmgrData entry
 * with callbacks for applying UNDO records and describing them for debugging.
 *
 * The generic UNDO infrastructure (undoapply.c) dispatches to the appropriate
 * RM callback based on the urec_rmid field in the UNDO record header.

/*
 * UNDO Resource Manager IDs
 *
 * Each AM or subsystem that writes UNDO records is assigned a unique ID.
 * This ID is stored in the urec_rmid field of every UNDO record header,
 * enabling the generic UNDO infrastructure to dispatch to the correct
 * apply callback during rollback.
 *
 * The core defines only UNDO_RMID_INVALID and the built-in index-AM IDs.
 * Every other consumer defines its own UNDO_RMID_* constant in its own
 * header (the same commit that registers it in access/undormgrlist.h), so
 * this core header names no specific table AM or subsystem.  The ID number
 * space is a shared resource: IDs must be unique and stable across releases
 * (they are stamped into WAL-durable UNDO records), so a new consumer takes
 * the next free value in [1, MAX_UNDO_RMGRS) and never reuses one.

 *   - info:        RM-specific subtype/flags from urec_info
 *   - xid:         Transaction being rolled back
 *   - reloid:      Target relation OID (may be InvalidOid for non-relation ops)
 *   - payload:     RM-specific opaque payload data
 *   - payload_len: Length of payload
 *   - urec_ptr:    Position of this record in UNDO log (for CLR generation)
 *
 * The callback is responsible for:
 *   - Opening the relation (if applicable)
 *   - Locking and modifying the target page
 *   - Generating a CLR WAL record
 *   - Releasing all locks and buffers

 *	  UNDO resource manager WAL record definitions
 *
 * This file contains the WAL record format definitions for UNDO log
 * operations. These records are logged by the RM_UNDO_ID resource manager.
 *
 * Record types:
 *   XLOG_UNDO_ALLOCATE       - Log UNDO space allocation
 *   XLOG_UNDO_DISCARD        - Log UNDO record discard
 *   XLOG_UNDO_EXTEND         - Log UNDO log file extension
 *   XLOG_UNDO_APPLY_RECORD   - CLR: Log physical UNDO application to a page
 *
 * The XLOG_UNDO_APPLY_RECORD type is a Compensation Log Record (CLR).
 * CLRs record the fact that an UNDO operation was applied to a page
 * during transaction rollback.  This ensures crash safety: if we crash
 * during rollback, the already-applied UNDO operations are preserved
 * via WAL replay of the CLR's full page image.

 * xl_undo_apply - CLR for physical UNDO application (physiological)
 *
 * This is a Compensation Log Record (CLR) generated when an UNDO record
 * is physically applied to a heap or index page during transaction rollback.
 *
 * Physiological CLR approach:
 *   Instead of storing a full 8KB page image (REGBUF_FORCE_IMAGE), we log
 *   just the operation and its data.  During redo, we re-apply the exact
 *   same page modification.  This reduces WAL volume from ~8KB to
 *   ~100-500 bytes per CLR.
 *
 *   For operations that only change LP state (INSERT undo, HOT_UPDATE kill),
 *   no additional data is needed -- the metadata in xl_undo_apply suffices.
 *
 *   For operations that restore tuple data (DELETE/UPDATE/INPLACE undo),
 *   the tuple data follows the fixed header as registered buffer data.
 *
 *   For full page image operations (DEDUP undo), REGBUF_FORCE_IMAGE is
 *   still used since the entire page is being replaced.
 *
 * CLR flags (in clr_flags):
 *   UNDO_CLR_HAS_TUPLE    - Tuple data follows (for DELETE/UPDATE/INPLACE)
 *   UNDO_CLR_HAS_DELTA    - Delta-encoded tuple data (for UPDATE)
 *   UNDO_CLR_LP_DEAD      - Mark line pointer LP_DEAD (for INSERT undo)
 *   UNDO_CLR_LP_UNUSED    - Mark line pointer LP_UNUSED (for INSERT undo)
 *   UNDO_CLR_FULL_PAGE    - Full page image (fallback, DEDUP undo)
 *   UNDO_CLR_HOT_RESTORE  - HOT update rollback (restore infomask + kill new)

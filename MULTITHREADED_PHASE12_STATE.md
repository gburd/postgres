# Phase 12 State Migration Notes

Phase 12 is in progress. The goal is to reduce reliance on thread-local
globals so sessions and executions can eventually move between carriers.

## CurrentSession Compatibility Bridge

The first Phase 12 slice moves ownership of the legacy `CurrentSession`
allocation under the `PgSession` runtime object:

- `PgSession` now has a `legacy_session` pointer;
- `InitializeSession()` first asks the current `PgSession` for its legacy
  session and allocates one in `TopMemoryContext` only when the object does not
  already own one;
- `InitializeSession()` installs the new allocation back onto `PgSession`, so
  `CurrentSession` remains the compatibility pointer used by typcache and
  parallel-query session DSM code;
- `InitPostgres()` no longer needs a process-specific
  `PgProcessRuntimeAttachSession()` call after `InitializeSession()`.

An attempted stronger version embedded `Session` storage directly inside
`PgSession`. That made the object ownership cleaner, but it regressed threaded
parallel CTAS in `001_threaded_runtime.pl`: the test stalled after launching
parallel worker thread carriers for the `threaded_runtime_stress` CTAS. The
safe bridge keeps `Session` allocated in `TopMemoryContext` for now while still
making `PgSession` the owner of the compatibility pointer. A future Phase 12
slice can revisit embedded storage with a focused threaded parallel-query
debugging fixture.

Validation for this slice:

- touched-object builds passed for `session.o`, `backend_runtime.o`, and
  `postinit.o`;
- full `gmake -j8` passed;
- `gmake -j8 install DESTDIR="$PWD/tmp_install"` passed, followed by
  reinstalling `src/test/modules/test_backend_runtime`;
- direct `prove` over
  `src/test/modules/test_backend_runtime/t/001_threaded_runtime.pl` and
  `src/test/modules/test_backend_runtime/t/002_threaded_bgworker_crash.pl`
  passed all 46 tests. This specifically reproved threaded CTAS, threaded
  parallel query, worker launch/shutdown/restart, cancellation, termination,
  PL/pgSQL, and crash escalation after the session bridge change;
- a direct process-mode temp-cluster smoke forced a two-worker parallel
  aggregate over a 200,000-row table. The plan contained `Gather Merge` with
  `Workers Planned: 2` and returned the expected row count, proving the
  per-session DSM handoff still works when parallel workers attach to the
  leader's session state.
